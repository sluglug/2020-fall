# Last time
- We covered using the shell and some command line tools.
- We entered individual commands manually into the shell.

# Shell scripts
- Use the shell's **programming features** to **automate** certain procedures
  and processes.
- Save commands in a file, so you don't forget them.
- Run many commands automatically, instead of manually typing them individually
  every time.
